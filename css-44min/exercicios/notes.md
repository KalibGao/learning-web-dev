<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

This is the responsive meta tag. It tells the browser to set the content width to the viewport one, ensuring
for the content to adapt automatically. It also tells the browser to set the zoom level to 1 initially, while still
allowing the user to zoom in (especially on mobile phones).
