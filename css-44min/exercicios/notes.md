<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

This is the responsive meta tag. It tells the browser to set the content width to the viewport one, ensuring
for the content to adapt automatically. It also tells the browser to set the zoom level to 1 initially, while still
allowing the user to zoom in (especially on mobile phones).

Before writing any CSS, you have to start with the most important of a webpage: the **content**.

*Order your CSS rules alphabetically*
When editing a CSS file, finding the declaration to change can be time consuming.
To reduce the cognitive load when both reading and writing rules, write them alphabetically.
It's the only sorting rule that is future-proof because it's opinionless.
When you will have more than 10 CSS declarations in a rule, you will be glad to know where to find what you
were looking for in a split second!
